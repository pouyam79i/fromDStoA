# Review 
here I am going to review all basic data structures. I will code them in C, and I will have java as my secondary programming language!<br><br>

## Data Structures
Data structure means organizing the data in the memory! <br>
There are two main type of data structure: <br>

    * Primitive Data Structures
    * Non-primitive Data Structures

<br>

## Primitive vs Non-primitive data Structures
Primitive data structure is a fundamental type of data structure that stores the data of only one type whereas the non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure which is a user-defined that stores the data of different types in a single entity.<br>
In programming, primitive data structures are defined by the language you use to code so I am going to focus on non-primitive ones!<br><br><br>

# Non-primitive data Structures
A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.<br>

Classification of data Structures:

    Linear
        Static
            Arrays
        Dynamic
            Linked List
            Stack
            Queue
    
    Non-linear
        Tree
        Graph

I am going to review all these basics of above classification!
