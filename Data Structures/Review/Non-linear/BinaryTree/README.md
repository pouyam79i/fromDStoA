# Binary Tree
Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

            root
            /  \
           /    \
          N1    N2


## NOTE
Well inserting to and organizing trees' algorithms can vary and there are lots of different methods!
Here I am going to create a tree with no rule, just as you above. but we are going to see a level order printing of our tree.
